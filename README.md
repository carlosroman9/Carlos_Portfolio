# **[Project 1: Arsenal-WFC-Usage-Rate Analysis](https://github.com/carlosroman9/Arsenal-WFC-Usage-Rate)**

Over the past year, women's soccer has significantly increased in popularity in the sports world. 
The FC Barcelona Women's team broke a world record for fan attendance in women’s soccer; reaching a capacity of 91,648 fans at the Camp Nou, the home stadium of FC Barcelona's Men’s team. 

Though viewership is rising, female soccer players are still relatively unknown, and I wanted to highlight women’s players and their performances. I wanted to produce a visualization that would show the top performing players. 
For this project, I selected to focus on the Arsenal Women’s team to analyze their player performances for the 2020/2021 season based on “usage rate,” and “positive rate.” I extracted JSON data from an open source data repository called “Stats Bomb.” 

I was inspired to pursue this project because of my interest in human performance and personnel recruitment. I also became interested in this type of analysis because of Brentford FC, a London based soccer club playing in England’s highest soccer division; the Premier League. Until two seasons ago, they were playing second in a second division league, but after embracing a data driven approach to player recruitment they achieved promotion and have stayed in Premier League since. 

What is “usage rate? And “positive rate?”
Usage rate is a term that is used in basketball statistics. It is a formula that calculates the percentage of actions a player takes when they are in possession of the ball (whether the outcome was positive or negative). In the scope of this project, I have only selected to include a player’s passes, shots, and dribbles in the calculation. Overall, I calculated each player’s usage rate by adding their individual totals in passes, shots, and dribbles by the team’s (all the players combined) shots, passes and dribbles. The positive rate is the same formula, but only counting completed passes and successful dribbles.

# **[Project 2: Data Wrangling, Analysis, and AB Testing UC Davis Coursera Course Case Study](https://github.com/carlosroman9/Data_WRangling_And_AB_Test)**

A project serving as a case study for AB testing analysis. The goal of the project was to see if there were increases in product views after a change in product landing pages and if there were increases in product sales after the  inclusion of a follow up email. For both scenarios, the outcomes were measured within 30 days of the test implementation. After establishing both tests, the results were checked for statistical significance with a 95% confidence interval calculation. 
 
* Simulated the process of creating an AB Test using SQL.
* Used CASE, CAST, JOINS, and subqueries to clean tables and create binary metrics. 

**Data Source:**

The data was provided by Coursera.

# **[Project 3: Wellness Center Usage Analysis](https://github.com/carlosroman9/Wellness_Center_Usage)**

One of my tasks while working as a Wellness Outreach Worker was to analyze our school’s wellness center usage. My task was to calculate the total number of students using the wellness center per day, per week, per month, and the total for the semester. I was also asked to break down check-ins by grade level, ethnicity of the student, and reason for visiting the wellness center. The data used in this project is synthetic. 

* Used this analysis to plan future mental health events for students (ex. planning de-stress activities before and during finals week due to an increase in student usage of the wellness center during those weeks)
* Shared analysis with PTSA officers and school administrators to advocate for increased financial support, increased therapeutic staff hiring, and clearance to create proposed mental health events

**Technologies Used:**
Excel/Google Sheets, R Studio

** Data Source:**

This data was formatted as if it were collected from a google form used by students to sign into the wellness center. The data is synthetic.
